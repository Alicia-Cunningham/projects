Purpose:
For our senior project, we set out to make an Over the Counter Hearing Aid, as to help bridge the finacial gap 
of medical care, since hearing aids can easily cost upwards of $1000. Our design would allow us to provide a 
quality hearing aid for around $30 to $40.

Description:
In order to achieve our goals, we designed our hearing aid to use both digital and analog components. We utilized 
chips such as the TLV320AIC10CPFB (ADC/DAC) and the TMS320VC5402PGE100 (DSP) to convert and process the audio the 
hearing aid picks up, to remove noise, equalize the volume, and raise the gain of higher frequency noises. Doing so 
improves the quality of the users experience, increases their auditory range and protects the user from sudden loud
noises that could further damage their hearing. Along with this, our hearing aid was designed to have adjustable 
volume, which was accomplished using a potentiometer and an amplifier.
