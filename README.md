Unbreakable Descrpition:

A SJSU Group project written in the C programming language. 
A choose your own adventure game that emphasizes modular design, user interaction, and randomization. 

Update 2024: Code Rewritten to not use conio.h, so the code can run easier on more platforms.

RFID Access Description:

A SJSU Group Project written in Arduino Code (C++)
This code was designed for an RFID-based access control system using the Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID module. 
This code initializes the NFC reader, checks for RFID tags, reads the tag's UID, and compares it to a predefined value. Based on the match, it either grants or denies access, indicated by controlling an LED.


Air Quality Monitor Description:

A personal project written in Arduino Code.
This code implements an air quality and temperature monitoring system using an OLED display and sensors.
Integrates the Adafruit SSD1306 library, utilizes a DHT11 sensor, to read the humity and temperature of the surrouding environment as well as an Air Quality sensor(MQ135).

Outputs real-time data on temperature, humidity, and air quality levels, updates dynamically.
