# Object-Oriented Pulsed Power Test & Measurement Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a modular, object-oriented Python framework designed to emulate
laboratory workflows for pulsed power experiments and electronic device characterization.
The framework mirrors the structure of real experimental test environments, including
pulse sources, devices under test (DUTs), measurement instrumentation, safety enforcement,
and post-test analysis.

The simulator is intended for algorithm development, test planning, and analysis workflow
validation prior to execution in a physical laboratory environment.

## Technical Objectives
- Model transient voltage and current behavior in pulsed electrical systems
- Emulate bench-level instrumentation and measurement acquisition
- Enforce configurable safety limits representative of high-consequence experiments
- Automate repeatable test sequences and structured data analysis

## Architecture
The framework is organized into independent modules representing key experimental components:
- Pulse generation
- Device under test (DUT) response
- Measurement instrumentation
- Safety monitoring and interlocks
- Test execution and analysis

This modular design supports extensibility and aligns with best practices for experimental
engineering software.

## Safety Considerations
All experiments are executed with predefined voltage, current, and energy limits.
Test execution is automatically aborted if any safety threshold is exceeded, reflecting
standard operational controls used in high-energy laboratory environments.

## Example Outputs
- Transient voltage and current waveforms
- Extracted metrics including peak values, rise time, and pulse energy
- Logged test results suitable for post-experiment review

## Future Work
- Expanded DUT models (RLC, nonlinear components)
- Frequency-domain analysis
- Batch testing and parameter sweeps
- Data export for external analysis tools

## Disclaimer
This software is a simulation-only tool and does not interface with physical hardware.
It is intended solely for modeling, analysis, and workflow development.
