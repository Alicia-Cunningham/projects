Overview
The Personal Banking System is a command-line application built in Python that allows users to manage their financial transactions efficiently. It supports adding, removing, searching, and displaying transactions while storing data in a JSON file for persistence. The system follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it modular and easy to extend.

Features
- Object-oriented design with Transaction and Bank classes
- Add, remove, and search transactions by title or type
- Save and load transactions using JSON file storage
- Error handling for robustness and reliability
- Simple and intuitive CLI interface

How It Works
Add a transaction – Enter a title, amount, and type (Withdrawal/Deposit).

Remove a transaction – Delete transactions by title.

Display transactions – View all stored transactions in a readable format.

Search transactions – Find transactions based on title or type.

Save transactions – Store transaction data in wallet.json.

Load transactions – Retrieve saved data upon program restart.

Installation & Usage
Requirements
Python 3.x

Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Implement a database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) for better storage
- Introduce user authentication for multiple account management
